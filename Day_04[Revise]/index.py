# Practice 1: Create a program that asks the user for their age and then calculates how many years it will take for them to turn 100.

# userAge = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# toHundred = 100 - userAge
# print(f"You will turn 100 in {toHundred} years")


# Practice 2: Write a program that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart, where the prices are integers.

item1 = 75;
item2 = 78;

total = item1 + item2;

# printing the total item 
print(f"The total item price is {total}$")
